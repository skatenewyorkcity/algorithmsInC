### CubedAlg
Program implements three for loops, which create a polynomial increase -- (O)^3 -- used to draw timing conclushing on runtime via 'clock()' function.

### forkedCubedAlg
Extended implementation of the 'cubedAlg'program that pulls data from a file, then calls a 'fork()' function to invoke a child process within a parent process, the former process prints values into screen while the latter process prints to a file.
